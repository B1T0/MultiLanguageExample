# MultiLanguageExample

I got bored and wanted to create a simple app that reads user input and prints the input until user supplies "q" to quit program, then I tried to see in how many languages I can write them in.

Please note that formating and the way they are written was done on purpose to cycle through all programs and see the similarities as they might not follow language specific conventions:

They should all run and compile just fine with standard libraries only, btw.

* C
* C++
* C#
* Objective C
* Java
* PHP
* Python (2 and 3)
* Perl
* Ruby
* Bash
* Go
* Lisp

Soon
* Javascript (NodeJs) Could not code it without breaking the pattern or using NPM readline-sync which is not standard.
* Dart
* R
* Erlang
* Swift
* Visual Basic

Suggestion?
